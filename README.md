# Taiko PP Calculator

An enhanced version of http://www.taikopp.com originaly made by KatK1 ([github](https://github.com/KatK1) | [osu! profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/21203707)) and kisperal ([github](https://github.com/thenerdie) | [osu! profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13581430)).

You have to include your own [API key](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api) inside of `api.js` in order to calculate with a beatmap ID.

Beatmap search only works with taiko maps, converts will not work.

This calculator is 100% accurate, any inaccuracies are due to SR being rounded to the second decimal place on the osu! website.

TODO:
- Recalculate variables for DT/HT
- ~~Improve site design~~
- ~~Improve dynamic resizing for multiple screen sizes/devices~~
- Fix more edge cases
- ~~Add style sheet~~
- ~~Add comments to html~~
