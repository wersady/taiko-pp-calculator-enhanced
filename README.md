You have to include your own [API key](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api) inside of `api.js` in order to calculate with a beatmap ID.

This calculator is 100% accurate, any inaccuracies are due to SR being rounded to the second decimal place on the osu! website.

TODO:
- Recalculate variables for DT/HT
- Improve site design
- Fix more edge cases
